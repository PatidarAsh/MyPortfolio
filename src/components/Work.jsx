          <p class="py-2 text-[#6a7280]">As a frontend developer, I focused on React applications, 
          integrating modern UI/UX designs that increased user engagement. 
          I successfully implemented Redux for state management. Additionally,
           I connected applications to backend services using REST APIs and collaborated across teams for seamless UI integration.
            With exposure to SaaS and Bootstrap, I actively participated in distributed Agile teams following SDLC in scrum meetings. 
            My role extended to developing, maintaining, and troubleshooting responsive websites for multiple clients, employing HTML, 
            CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Conducting user research, I identified and addressed user needs efficiently.</p>
